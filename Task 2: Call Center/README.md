# Call Center Dashboard
This repository contains the work done as part of the PwC Virtual Internship provided by Forage. The project involved creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize call center performance data.

# Project Overview
The task was to design and develop a Power BI dashboard that reflects relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics for a call center operation. The goal was to provide insights into various aspects of call center performance, such as customer satisfaction, call volume, agent productivity, and service quality.

# Dataset
The project used a dataset containing call center data, including information about:

- Number of calls answered and resolved
- Customer satisfaction ratings
- Average speed of answer (ASA)
- Agent performance metrics (e.g., calls handled, average handle time)
- Call topics or categories
The dataset covered a three-month period from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2021.

# Dashboard Design
The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations and KPIs:

1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction**: A card visualization displaying the average customer satisfaction rating across all agents for the given period.

2. **Calls Answered and Abandoned**: A donut chart showing the percentage of calls answered and abandoned, along with the total number of calls.

3. **Call Volume by Month**: A line chart visualizing the number of calls received per month to identify peak periods or trends.

4. **Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**: A card visualization displaying the overall average speed of answer (ASA) in seconds.

5. **Agent Performance Quadrant**: A scatter plot or bubble chart representing agents' performance based on the number of calls answered and the average handle time.

6. **Calls by Topic**: A stacked bar chart illustrating the distribution of calls across different topics or categories.

7. **Agent Performance Comparison**: A table or matrix visualization comparing the performance of different agents based on metrics such as calls answered, resolved, satisfaction rating, and ASA.

8. **Filters and Slicers**: Interactive elements like filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data further and gain deeper insights.
